Indifference grows, indifference feeds on me
A sickness fills the pathways where I breathe
Miles away from where I want to be, want to be

One day you will see!
Nothing is this simple, this simple
One day you will see!
It takes its toll on me, toll on me

Hey! Lie awake and wait out all those
Days! Till I finally come home
Changed and jaded, everything that I hate
I'll be there...

Trading in my youth, for broken wings
As I slowly watch you
Walk away, so walk away
Will you stay, will you stay, will you walk away?

Fall asleep to flashing screens and paper cuts, yeah
Waking up with vacant eyes and broken hearts again

One day you will see!
(One day you will see!)
Nothing is this simple, this simple
One day you will see!
(One day you will see!)
It takes its toll on me, toll on me

Hey! Lie awake and wait out all those
Days! Till I finally come home
Changed and jaded, everything that I hate
I'll be there...
